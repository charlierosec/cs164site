        If you're here, you're probably in CS-164 at Drexel University.
        I'm probably your TA, Charlie.
        <br>
        So why did I make this site?
        This class can get away from you really easy.
        There's a lot of information and it builds on itself, so if you miss one thing, you could be lost for a while.
        There's also very little information to acquire on your own.
        The lecture slides are posted on BBLearn but that's about it.
        So out of the good of my heart, I made this website for y'all.
        I hope you guys enjoy.
