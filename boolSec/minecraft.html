				Now, you may have gotten this far and you're thinking, 
				what does the best game in the world have to do with boolean algebra?
				I will tell you!
				This section is a section completely of my own doing.
				You will never be tested on Minecraft in this class.
				This is a way for you to apply boolean algebra in a fun game.
				If you don't know anything about Minecraft or don't care about Minecraft, you can skip this.

			<h3 style="color:#DD1111">Redstone</h3>
			<p>
				I don't know about you, but I started Minecraft back when it was in alpha.
				Zombies dropped feathers and hunger didn't exist.
				I was about 10 years old.
				At 10 years old, I was not very good at video games.
				I am still not very good at video games.
				The point is, I was not old enough or smart enough to figure out redstone properly.
				I was barely smart enough to survive the day in Minecraft.
				For me, a redstone torch was just an annoyingly dim torch.
				Now, after learning a lot more about boolean algebra and computers, and revisting Minecraft
				(dude there are dolphins now),
				redstone makes a lot more sense.
			</p>
			<p>
				For the most part, the redstone transfers over to the real life circuits really well.
				There are a few inconsistencies.
				Levers can be considered switches for the most part, however, in real life, switches
				don't create an on signal by themselves.
				Also, while there is some resistance in wires, you don't completely lose any signal
				within 15 feet. 
				Redstone wire can only carry a signal 15 blocks before needing a repeater.
				Other than that, the gates are fairly simple.
				The image below shows how to build each gate.

			<p>
				Something I want you to notice is the difference between the AND and NAND circuits.
				Compare them.
				NAND is actually simpler than AND.
				It is only less complicated by one block, but it's still a simpler circuit.
				One of the reasons NAND is a popular gate is not only because it's a universal gate, but it
				also has a simple makeup.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am going to leave you with this and nothing else.
				It is up to you to build some circuits in Minecraft with this information.
				Build computers.
				Have fun.
