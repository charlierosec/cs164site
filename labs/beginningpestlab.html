	<h1>Beginning the Virtual Pest</h1>
	<p>
		Answer all questions in a <i>plain text file</i>
		named <code>questions8.txt</code>.
		At the top of your plain text file, include your name, student ID, and lab section.
		<code>pestp1.t</code> should be a separate .t file. 
		Do not add a .txt extension.
		Your source code should be a plain .t file.
		Use <code>scp</code> to retrieve this file from tux.
		Failure to do so will result in a 0.
	</p>
	<p>	
		This is the first step in a series of labs that will culminate in the 
		development of your own virtual pet implemented using HTML and Tranquility
	</p>

	<h3>Question 1 - The Only Question (25pts)</h3>
	<p>	
		There are several steps to this phase of the project:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Locate or create a series of images that represent your pet in various moods, e.g. hungry, happy, sleepy, angry, etc. If you decide later that you want to use a different set of images, you are free to change them.</li>
		<li>Using Tranquility, create a web page with the image of your pet in its relaxed state, and a button on the page.</li>
		<li>Update the Tranquility code for your page so that each time the button is clicked, a different one of the mood pictures is shown.  The effect of repeated clicks should be to cycle through all of the pictures you have.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		For this question, put the link to your webpage titled <code>pestp1.html</code>
	</p>
