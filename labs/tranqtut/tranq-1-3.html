<h1>
To Assign is to Store
</h1>
		
<p>
			In Tranquility, unlike most mainstream languages, the colon
			(
<code>
:
</code>
) is used for 
<i>
assignment.
</i>
			Most mainstream languages however use the equals sign
			(
<code>
=
</code>
) for assignment.
			It is often said that this is like an equality in mathematic,
			but there are important differences that you need to
			internalize.
			In math, if we make a statement such as 
<i>
y
</i>
=2
<i>
x
</i>
+5,
			then we are typically establishing a relationship between 
<i>
x
</i>
			and 
<i>
y
</i>
 that remains true thoughout the problem we're
			solving or proof we're developing.
			In other words, no matter what 
<i>
x
</i>
 is, 
<i>
y
</i>
 will 
<b>
always
</b>
			be 2
<i>
x
</i>
+5.
		
</p>
		
<p>
			Establishing a relationship is not the right way to think about
			assignment in programming.
			The reason is that programming is not about establishing static
			relationships; it's about specifying a sequence of actions through
			time.
			So if the current value of 
<i>
x
</i>
 is 3, then when we execute
			the statement 
<i>
y
</i>
=2
<i>
x
</i>
+5, then 
<i>
y
</i>
 will get
			the value 11.
			That much is what we'd expect from math, but if later 
<i>
x
</i>
			changes, then 
<i>
y
</i>
 doesn't change correspondingly.
			Similarly, we can't assert that 
<i>
y
</i>
 is a particular value
			and expect that the computer will solve for 
<i>
x
</i>
.
			The way we want to think about this is that the assignment
			sets 
<i>
y
</i>
 to 11 at a particular point in time, but that later
			
<i>
x
</i>
 and 
<i>
y
</i>
 can change independently of each other.

			Although you haven't seen the details of what the operations
			on the right-hand side of the assignments do, study the
			assignments in the CARDIAC simulator.
			Based on these statements and what you know about the
			CARDIAC, what instruction would be used in the CARDIAC
			to carry out an assignment?
