<h1>
You're Going to Forget the Dot
</h1>
		
<p>
			The next part goes over operators in much more depth.
			However, I will be using them to explain a concept here.
			I apologize in advance.
		
</p>
		
<p>
			Tranquility has a feature that not many languages have, it's called
			"the dot". Technically, the proper name would be a pointer dereference, however,
			ask any TA or student, and we call it "the dot". A pointer is the address of
			a variable. The contents of a variable are separate from the address of a 
			variable.
		
</p>
<pre>
	var w, x, y, z
	w : 7
	x : 4
	y : 1
	z : 69
</pre>

<p>
			So what does memory location and value mean? Let's think about memory and 
			visualize it. In the above code, there are 4 variables, 
<i>
w, x, y, z
</i>
.
			Each variable refers to a location in memory. This location is referenced using
			a number. In the above, 
<i>
w
</i>
 refers to memory location 65535. The value that
			memory location 65535 contains is 7. In order to differentiate between 
<i>
w
</i>
 and
			the contents of 
<i>
w
</i>
 (7), we use the dot. This means, the contents of 
<i>
w
</i>
			is denoted by 
<code>
.w
</code>
		
</p>
		
<p>
			Now, how do we apply this information? How do we know when to use a dot? 
			First, let's translate colon (
<code>
:
</code>
) to be "set the contents of".
			So to set the contents of 
<i>
x
</i>
, (
<code>
.x
</code>
) we'd use 
			`
<code>
x : something
</code>
`. So in this case, we do not use the dot.
			In order to use the contents of x, like in an equation or something, 
			you would do `
<code>
.x == .y
</code>
`

			Which of the following uses proper dot notation to put the value 7 in
