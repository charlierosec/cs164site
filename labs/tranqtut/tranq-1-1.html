<h1>
A Blissful Beginning
</h1>
		
<p>
			Let's begin here, this class is 
<i>
not
</i>
 a programming class.
			The purpose of this class is not to teach you to be a master programmer.
			We are merely using programming as a way to teach problem solving and
			logic. 
			That is what the essence of what programming is: problem solving and logic.
		
</p>
		
<p>
	
			Tranquility is a language we created for this class where syntax, built-in
			functions, and IDEs are 
<i>
not
</i>
 the focus.
			Our focus is the process behind sequentially solving a problem.
			This is a language that is meant to be taught, not used in industry.
		
</p>
		
<p>
			That being said, we try and keep Tranquility fairly internal.
			No Googling, no StackOverflow.
			Instead, we provide with you this ancient tomb, the 
			
<a href="http://cs.drexel.edu/~bls96/tranquility.pdf">
Tranquility Programmers Manual.
</a>
			This artifact contains important information that can answer most, if not all
			of your Tranquility questions.
			Any other questions you have can be answered by your wise TAs and Professor.
