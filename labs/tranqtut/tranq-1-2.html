<h1>
Swear Not Upon the Variable Moon
</h1>
		
<p>
			When working with the CARDIAC, we found it useful to allocate
			places in memory where we would store data while we were
			working on it.
			We often refer to these as 
<i>
variables.
</i>
			It's important to note that the way we use variables in computing
			is a little different than the way they are used in Math.
			Often in Math we'll make a statement like 
<i>
y
</i>
=2
<i>
x
</i>
			and then use 
<i>
y
</i>
 as being equal to twice 
<i>
x
</i>
 for
			the rest of the proof or calculation we're working on.
			But that's not the way they work in programming.
			The best way to think of variables in programming is as a box
			where you can put something or take something out, but where
			that something doesn't automatically change while it's in there.

<form method = "GET">
				On the CARDIAC in assembly language, we used a directive
				called DATA to give a name to a memory location.
				This is how we created a variable there.
				Look at the code for the CARDIAC simulator.
				What keyword is used in Tranquility to create a variable?
