Smooth Operators
</h1>
		
<p>
			Now let's turn our attention to the expressions that are on the
			right-hand side of assignments.
			In this tutorial, we will focus mostly on the basic arithmetic
			operations.
			Two of the most basic are addition and subtraction, which, as
			you can probably guess, are notated with the `+' and `-' characters.
			So the expression 
<code>
a+b
</code>
 in Tranquility will 
<i>
evaluate
</i>
			to be the sum of the two variables 
<i>
a
</i>
 and 
<i>
b
</i>
.
			Evaluating an expression means that we calculate the value of
			that expression at that point in time.
		
</p>
		
<p>
			Expressions can be used anywhere a value such as a constant
			or a variable can be used.
			For our purposes here, we'll focus on their use on the right-hand
			side of assignments.
			Consider the statement:
			
<pre>
c : .a - .b
			
</pre>
			Although we might think of this as a single step in our program,
			it's actually several steps inside the machine:
			
<ol>
				
<li>
 Fetch the contents of the variable 
<i>
a
</i>
.
				
<li>
 Handle 
<i>
b
</i>
				
<ol type="a">
					
<li>
 Fetch the contents of 
<i>
b
</i>
.
					
<li>
 Subtract the contents of 
<i>
b
</i>
 from that of 
<i>
a
</i>
.
				
</ol>
				
<li>
 Store the result in 
<i>
c
</i>
.
			
</ol>
		
<p>
			We've divided the steps as shown to highlight certain aspects
			of the sequence.
			To start with, depending on the machine design, Step&nbsp;2
			might be handled as a single step, or as two separate steps,
			2a and 2b.
			The second thing to highlight is that Steps&nbsp;1 and&nbsp;2
			together comprise the evaluation of the expression 
<code>
.a-.b
</code>
.
			This is done prior to the assignment getting carried out.
			It is important to remember that's the sequence of the timing of any
			assignment statement.
			First, the expression on the righ-hand side is evaluated, and then
			the result is stored in the left-hand side.
			The details of the sequence lead us directly into understanding
			how such a statement is executed on the computer.
			Using CARDIAC as an example, the statement:
			
<pre>
c : .a - .b
			
</pre>
			might be compiled to the instruction sequence:
			
<pre>
     CLA   a
     SUB   b
     STO   c
			
</pre>
		
<p>
			Before moving on, we should mention some of the other operators
			that can be used in expressions.
			The asterisk (*) character is used for multiplication, slash (/) is used
			for division, and percent (%) is used for the remainder after division
			(or modulus).

</pre>
			
<p><input type=radio name=ans value=1> <code>x : y + y</code>
