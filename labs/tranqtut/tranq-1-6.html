<h1>
Decisions, Decisions
</h1>
		
<p>
			While working with the CARDIAC, we saw the 
<code>
TAC
</code>
			instruction that could be used to make logical decisions by conditionally
			jumping to another memory location based on the value of the
			accumulator.
			Higher-level languages like Tranquility also provide mechanisms
			for conditionally transferring control.
			The primary statement we'll be studying is the 
<b>
if
</b>
 statement.
			Let's look at the below example.
<pre>
    if .mode == 0 {
        x : .x + 1
    }
    else {
        x : .x - 1
    }
    x : .x * 2
</pre>
			Conceptually, this code just looks at the variable 
<i>
mode
</i>
			and in the case that it's 0, the code performs addition.
			However, if 
<i>
mode
</i>
 is not 0, then it performs subtraction.
			In either case, the multiplication is performed.
		
<p>
			Notice that the operator that is used to compare 
<i>
mode
</i>
			to 0 is the 
<code>
==
</code>
 operator.
			The single instance of the equal sign (=) does not do anything in
			Tranquility.
			However, the double equal sign (==) signifies comparison.
			Remember this.
			It will be the same for many of the languages you will learn.
		
</p>
		
<p>
			To understand how this works, we'll break it down into steps
			like those performed by the computer when executing this
			code:
		
</p>
		
<ol>
			
<li>
 Evaluate the condition asking whether 
<i>
mode
</i>
 equals 0.
			
<li>
 If the test is true, then jump to Step&nbsp;5.
			
<li>
 Perform addition
			
<li>
 Jump to Step&nbsp;6.
			
<li>
 Perform subtraction
			
<li>
 Perform muliplication
		
</ol>
		
<p>
			We won't go through the details of how this would be
			implemented on the actual CARDIAC.
			(Hint: If mode is non-negative and 0-mode is also non-negative,
			then we know it's equal to 0.)
			Instead, we're going to pretend that there's another instruction
			in the CARDIAC that we'll call 
<code>
TAZ
</code>
.
			This instruction is much like 
<code>
TAC
</code>
 except that
			the jump occurs if the accumulator is 0.
			We're also going to take advantage of an aspect of the 
<code>
JMP
</code>
			instruction that we haven't used before.
			In particular, the 
<code>
JMP
</code>
 instruction not only changes
			the PC to point to a new instruction, but it also saves the old PC
			so that we can pick up where we left off.
			With that in mind, we can implement the steps of the 
<code>
if
</code>
			statement as follows:
		
</p>
<pre>
if      CLA     mode
        TAZ     istrue
        JMP     dostep
        JMP     endif
istrue  JMP     clearinterval
endif
</pre>
		
<hr>
		At the end of the following code, what is the final value
		of the variable 
<code>
x
</code>
?
<pre>
var x,y
x : 5
y : 7
if .x &gt; .y {
   if .y == 8 {
      x : .y
   }
   else {
      x : .x + 1
   }
}
else {
   if .y &lt; 10 {
      x : .x - 1
   }
   else {
      x : .y + 2
   }
}
</pre>
