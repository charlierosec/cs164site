<h1>
Oh No, Not Again
</h1>
		
<p>
			When working with the CARDIAC, conditional branching wasn't
			the only use we made of jumping.
			The other big reason for jumping to another place in the code is
			to repeat some part of the code.
			A block of code that is repeated under certain circumstances
			is called a 
<i>
loop
</i>
.
			In many languages, there are several different types of loop structures.
			However, in tranquility, there is only one loop, the 
<code>
loop
</code>
.
		
</p>
		
<p>
			A loop is quite simple to use. It will continue repeating the same block 
			of code 
<code>
until
</code>
 a certain condition is met. The 
<code>
until
</code>
			statement defines a condition, that when true, will end the loop. Let's look
			at the example below. Read through it and see if you can see what's happening.
		
</p>
<pre>
var i
i : 1
loop {
    until .i > 100
    iprint(.i)
    nl()
    i : .i + 1
}
</pre>
		
<p>
			The above loop runs 100 times. We know this because we start with 
<i>
i
</i>
 being
			1. The loop runs until 
<i>
i
</i>
 is greater than 100. Since we increment 
<i>
i
</i>
			in steps of 1, we run 100 times. Now, everytime we run the block, we use an integer
			print statement (
<code>
iprint
</code>
) to print out the contents of 
<i>
i
</i>
		
</p>
		
<hr>
		What is the final value of the variable 
<i>
x
</i>
 after
		this code is run?
<pre>
var x, i, j
x : 0
i : 0
loop {
    until .i &gt; 3
    j : 0
    loop { 
        until .j &gt; 2
        x : .x + .i * .j
        j : .j + 1
    }
    i : .i + 1
}
</pre>
