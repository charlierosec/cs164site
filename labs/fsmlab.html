	<h3>Question 1 - The Only Question (25pts)</h3>
	<p>	
		Suppose you're working for some large unnamed online retail company, let's call them Nile.  
		Everyone has agreed that it would be a good idea to weigh all the boxes that make up an order.  
		Your task is to develop the system that gathers the data.  
		After considering it for a while, you have settled on the following:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Each order has a barcode that is to be scanned at the beginning and end of each order.</li>
		<li>Each package has a barcode that is to be scanned prior to its weight being sent.</li>
		<li>For each input (barcode or weight) either a red or green light is turned on for a second as feedback to the operator.</li>
		<li>The green light indicates that the input was accepted.</li>
		<li>The red light indicates that an input was out of sequence and the operator needs to repeat some part of the operation.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		The normal procedure for the operator is to start processing an order by scanning the order's barcode.  
		Then for each package in the order, the operator scans the package barcode, and pushes the weight button.
		Once all the packages are weighed, the operator scans the order barcode again to close the order.  
		At each of those steps, if the operator has taken the correct action, a green light is shown.  
		But if the operator presents one of the inputs out of order, the red light is shown.
	</p>
	<p>
		So the question is how do we know which light to illuminate?  
		The answer comes down to knowing how we got to our current situation and what input we receive.  
		If we're in the situation where we're currently processing and order and the last thing we got was a package barcode,
		then getting a weight should result in a green light. 
		On the other hand if the last thing we got was a weight, then another weight should result in a red light.
	</p>
	<p>
		In a state machine the state summarizes the past and tells us what our current situation is.  
		Then the current state and the new input tell us what to do next.  
		In this situation, the what to do next is what light to turn on and what new state to go to.  
		Of course, we need to account for all the combinations of state and input.  
		One way to express this is with a table such as:
	</p>
	<center>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<th></th>
			<th>0</th>
			<th>1</th>
			<th>2</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th>O</th>
			<td>1/G</td>
			<td>0/G</td>
			<td>0/R</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th>P</th>
			<td>0/R</td>
			<td>2/G</td>
			<td>1/R</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th>W</th>
			<td>0/R</td>
			<td>1/R</td>
			<td>1/G</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	</center>
	<p>
		In this particular case, it so happens that we have three states and three inputs, but they're not always the same.  
		We can describe the states as follows:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>0 : Not currently processing an order</li>
		<li>1 : Processing and order waiting to process a package</li>
		<li>2 : Processing a package waiting for the weight</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Similarly, the inputs are:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>O : The order barcode</li>
		<li>P : The package barcode</li>
		<li>W : The package weight</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		In the cells of the table, each entry contains a number and a letter. 
		The number gives the new state and the letter is which color of light to show.  
		For example, if the machine is in state 1 and gets an O input, then the machine changes to state 0 and shows the green light. 
		These changes in state are called transitions.  
		This particular transition represents the operator scanning the order barcode after processing all the packages to close out the order.
	</p>
	<p>
		Another common way of illustrating a state machine is a diagram where the states are shown as circles and the transitions are shown as arrows.  
		The machine discussed here can be illustrated as follows:

	<p>
		Now, let's turn to how to implement a state machine in Tranquility code.  
		One of the easiest ways to implement a state machine is to define a function for each input.  
		Inside the function, a series of if statements test the current state and do the state updates.  
		In terms of the table shown above, this function implements one row of the table.  
		Based on that table, a function for handling the weight would look like:
	</p>
<pre>
fun proc_weight() {
    if .state == 0 {
        state : 0
        do_red()
    }
    else if .state == 1 {
        state : 1
        do_red()
    }
    else if .state == 2 {
        state : 1
        do_green()
    }
}
</pre>
	<p>
		In some cases, the state change in the if statement is redundant as the machine actually stays in the same state.
		Those assignments could safely be omitted.
		Also note that the state variable needs to be declared globally so that it is shared among all of the functions.
	</p>
	<p>
		Your task is to complete the implementation of this state machine.  
		Use a button for each of the three inputs, and use a text area to report which light is on.
