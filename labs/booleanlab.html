	<h1>Boolean Algebra</h1>
	<p>
		Answer all questions in a <i>plain text file</i> named questions2.txt .
		At the top of your plain text file, include your name, user id, and lab section.
		Last week you learned how to use nano.
		Try using nano on Tux to answer these questions instead of using a GUI editor.

	<h3>Question 1 - Tutorial (10pts)</h3>
	<p>	
		Your first step in this lab is to complete the interactive tutorial on
		Boolean algebra found at
		<a href="https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~bls96/cs164/logtut/logic.html">this link</a>.
		Were you successfully able to complete the tutorial?
		What issues did you have in completing it?
		What was the answer for Part 5?
	</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Question 2 (10pts)</h3>
	<p>
		Open a window or tab with the 
		<a href="https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~bls96/cs164/logwb/logwb.html">digital logic workbench</a>.
		Drag a DC component, a Toggle component, and an LED component into the workspace.  
		Draw a connection between the open circle of the DC component and the yellow
		circle of the Toggle component.
		Then draw a connection between the open circle of the Toggle component
		to the yellow circle of the LED component.  
		Describe what happens when you click on the button in the middle of the Toggle component.
	</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Question 3 (10pts)</h3>
	<p>
		Modify your circuit so that you have an inverter between the toggle switch and the LED.  
		How does the addition of the inverter change the behavior of the circuit?
	</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Question 4 (10pts)</h3>
	<p>
		Wire up the half adder from the lecture slides.
		You'll need two toggle switches and two LEDs.
		You can remove components from your circuit by dragging them to the toolbar on the left.
		Also note that in this simulator, the exclusive-OR device is labeled EOR, rather than XOR.
		Use the toggle switches to try all combinations of input.
		Record the output values to create a truth table for both the sum and carry.
	</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Question 5 (10pts)</h3>
	<p>
		Add a 4bit7seg device to your circuit.
		You should connect the top yellow circle of the display to the 
		sum of your adder and the second one to the carry.  
		What happens now when you go through all combinations of the toggle switch settings?
	</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Question 6 (10pts)</h3>
	<p>
		Keep your adder circuit on your worksheet and create a separate circuit 
		that implements the Boolean expression &#172;(x &#8743; &#172;y).  
		Verify your circuit by testing all combinations of inputs and enter the truth table here.
	</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Question 7 (15pts)</h3>
	<p>
		A mathematician who was a contemporary of George Boole was Augustus DeMorgan.  
He was one of Ada Lovelace's mathematics tutors.
		DeMorgan is best known for the following two laws:
		<br>
		<br>
		<tab5><code>&#172;(x &#8743; y) = &#172;x &#8744; &#172;y</code></tab5>
		<br>
		<tab5><code>&#172;(x &#8744; y) = &#172;x &#8743; &#172;y</code></tab5>
		<br>
		<br>
		Use these equalities to write a simpler version of the expression from the last question.
		It should involve one fewer NOT operators.
	</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Question 8 (10pts)</h3>
	<p>
		Add a third circuit in the workbench that implements your simpler expression.
		Verify that it produces the correct results by generating a 
		truth table and put it in the answer box.
	</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Question 9 (15pts)</h3>
	<p>
		You should now have three circuits on your worksheet: 
		a half-adder with a display and two different circuits that compute the same Boolean function.  
		Print your final workspace to a PDF file and upload that PDF file along with your answer sheet.
