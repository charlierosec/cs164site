		As usual, answer all questions in a <i>plain text file</i>
		named <code>questions3.txt</code>.
		Failure to do so will result in a 0.
		At the top of your plain text file, include your name, student ID, and lab section.

	<h3>Question 1 (5pts)</h3>
	<p>	
		In class, we discussed hexadecimal as a convenient representation of numbers.  
		One place where that gets used frequently is specifying colors on web pages.  
		For the next several questions, you are encouraged to use the web to find any answers you don't already know.
		<br><br>
		How many hexadecimal digits are used specify a color in a web page? 
		How many bits do these hexadecimal digits correspond to?
	</p>
	<br>

	<h3>Question 2 (10pts)</h3>
	<p>
		What colors are specified by these hexadecimal values?  
		How many bits are assigned to each color?
	</p>
	<br>

	<h3>Question 3 (10pts)</h3>
	<p>
		What is the range of values for each of the primary colors used on web pages?
	</p>
	<br>


	<h3>Question 4 (10pts)</h3>
	<p>
		There are about 16 million possible colors that can be specified in this way.
		A relatively small subset have been given standard names.  
		What are the hexadecimal values for the following colors: Heliotrope Purple, Dimorphotheca Magenta, and Rubber Ducky Yellow?
	</p>
	<br>

	<h3>Question 5 (10pts)</h3>
	<p>
		In HTML, we can include any Unicode characters.  All special characters in HTML are specified in the form:
		<br><br>
		&spec;
		<br><br>
		These special characters all start with the ampersand and end with a semicolon.
		How would you specify the symbols and &#172; , &#8744; , and &#8743; in HTML?
	</p>
	<br>

	<h3>Question 6 (10pts)</h3>
	<p>
		In class, we discussed how the XOR function could be implemented using AND, OR, and NOT.  
		Using the codes from the previous question, write the HTML for the XOR implementation.
	</p>
	<br>

	<h3>Question 7 (10pts)</h3>
	<p>
		In HTML, we can also create tables pretty easily.  A table begins with the string:
		<br><br>	
		&lt;table&gt;
		<br><br>
		and ends with the string:
		<br><br>
		&lt;/table&gt;
		<br><br>
		This is typical of many parts of HTML.
		In HTML, things enclosed in angle brackets are called tags.  
		Many tags come in pairs where the first opens a structure and the structue is closed by the same tag with a slash prepended.  
		Here, the table is specified between the &lt;table&gt; tag and the &lt;/table&gt; tag.
		<br><br>
		Tables are composed of rows, each of which has a number elements.
		What are the tags used to start and end a row of a table?
	</p>
	<br>

	<h3>Question 8 (5pts)</h3>
	<p>
		What are the tags used to begin and end a table data element?
	</p>
	<br>

	<h3>Question 9 (5pts)</h3>
	<p>
		Now, let's put the colors and the tables together.
		The background color of a table cell can be specified as part of the tag for a table data element.  
		How would you specify a table cell with a background color of Ferrari Red?
	</p>
	<br>
	
	<h3>Question 10 (5pts)</h3>
	<p>
		Pick a pair of colors that will work well as the colors for a chess board.  
		What colors did you pick?
	</p>
	<br>
		
	<h3>Question 11 (20pts)</h3>
	<p>
		For this last step of the lab, 
		create a web page that uses a table to draw a chess board and uses the Unicode symbols for the pieces on the board.
		Use the colors you chose in the previous question to make the checkerboard pattern.
		Put the URL for your new page in the answer.
