	<h1>Easing into HTML</h1>
	<p>
		This week's lab builds on what you did the first week.
		By the end of this lab, you should be more familiar with transferring
		files back and forth between your computer and tux, editing HTML files,
		and understanding what goes into an HTML file.
	</p>
	<p>
		Make sure to answer the following lab questions in a plain text file named questions.txt
		At the top of your plain text file, include your name, user id, and lab section.
	</p>

	<hr>
	<h3>Question 1 (5pts)</h3>
	<p>	
		As with last week's lab, your first step this week is to work through a brief tutorial.
		This one begins your introduction to HTML, the language used for web pages.  
		It will also point you to a very extensive online resource for learning HTML and other web technologies
		Follow
		<a href="https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~bls96/cs164/htmltut/html.html">this link</a>
		to begin the tutorial.
		<br>
		<br>
		Were you able to get through the tutorial and make your way to the w3schools?
		Put the link to w3schools as your answer.
	</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Question 2 (10pts)</h3>
	<p>
		Point your browser to the page:
		<br>
		<br>
		<tab5>http://www.pages.drexel.edu/~bls96/bioskel.html</tab5>
		<br>
		<br>
		Your browser will have a mechanism for viewing the HTML source of the page. 
		The exact steps, however, vary from browser to browser.
		You may have to do some experimenting or searching online for the steps to follow on your browser.
		View the HTML source of the file you just loaded.  
		For an answer, state what browser you're using and what was required to view the source in that browser.
	</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Question 3 (5pts)</h3>
	<p>
		You should notice that the second line of the file begins with the characters:
		<br>
		<br>
		<tab5><code>&lt;!--</code></tab5>
		<br>
		<br>
		Strings of characters enclosed in the angle brackets (&lt; and &gt;) are called <i>tags</i>
		in HTML, and they serve as commands to the browser.
		This particular tag (starting with &lt;!--) indicates a comment.  
		Comments are used by one programmer (or HTML author) to another and are meant to be
		ignored by the machine that's operating on the file (in this case, the browser).
		What does the comment on the second line of the file say?
	</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Question 4 (5pts)</h3>
	<p>
		Save this file to your computer with the name bio.html. 
		Put the full path name of the file on your computer into the answer box below.
	</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Question 5 (5pts)</h3>
	<p>
		Your next step is to copy the bio.html file from your computer to tux.
		You'll use scp either in the command line form or as used by a GUI application such as SecureShell or CyberDuck.  
		Once you've copied the file and gotten all the permissions correct, 
		you should be able to load the file in your browser from tux.  
		Describe any issues you encountered getting to this point.
	</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Question 6 (5pts)</h3>
	<p>
		Looking again at the HTML source file, 
		what HTML tag is used to begin the section of basic biographical information?
	</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Question 7 (5pts)</h3>
	<p>
		What tag is used to start a bulleted list?
	</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Question 8 (5pts)</h3>
	<p>
		What tag is used to begin each item in the list?
	</p>
	<br>
 	<h3>Question 9 (5pts)</h3>
	<p>
		What tag is used to end the list?
	</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Question 10 (10pts)</h3>
	<p>
		Edit the bio.html file to fill in the information as it applies to you.  
		There are two basic approaches you may take:
		<ol>
			<li>
				You may edit the copy of bio.html that you have on your local computer.
				Each time you want to view the changes, you will copy the file from your 
				computer to tux and reload the page in your browser.
				The advantage to this method is that you can use an editor that you're familiar with.
			</li>
			<li>
				You may edit the copy of bio.html that is on tux. 
				The advantage to this method is that you don't have to copy 
				the file back to tux each time you make a change.
			</li>
		</ol>
		Which method did you choose to use and why?
	</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Question 11 (5pts)</h3>
	<p>
		Now edit your index.html file to include a link to your new bio.html file.
		Follow the example for linking to another HTML file that's currently in your index.html file.
		Remember that you should already have a copy of that file on your computer from last week.
		So you again can choose whether to edit the file on your computer and copy 
		the new version to tux or to edit directly on tux.  
		For an answer, copy-and-paste the HTML code that you added to your index.html file.
	</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Question 12 (10pts)</h3>
	<p>
		Return to your bio.html file to edit it again.
		Following the example that's there, create a new section to list your hobbies.
		Feel free to list as many as you like and to say as much as you like about each one.  
		At least one of your list items should include a link to an external 
		(i.e. not on www.cs.drexel.edu) web page.  
		Did you run into any problems?  
		What were they and how did you resolve them?
	</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Question 13 (10pts)</h3>
	<p>
		Add at least one image on your bio page.
		The details for handling images are not found in either the previous examples nor the tutorial.  
		This is intentional.  
		Part of the intent of this step is self-learning.  
		You should do some external research to find out how to include images.  
		(Hint: the web site that you were pointed to at the end of the tutorial is a good reference for such things.)  
		<br>
		<br>
		Honors students: make the image itself a link so that when the user clicks on it, they are taken to another page.
		This is required for honors students, not for regular students.
		If you aren't honors, feel free to experiment with links and images.
		<br>
		<br>
		For an answer, summarize how you learned about images in HTML.  
		Did you make your image a link?  
		Did you run into any issues getting it to work on tux?
	</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Question 14 (5pts)</h3>
	<p>
		The last modification that you need to make to your bio.html file is to add a section with your career goals.  
		Which browser have you been using to test all these changes?
	</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Question 15 (5pts)</h3>
	<p>
		Different browsers sometimes interpret the HTML differently.
		This is especially problematic if there are errors in the HTML file.
		Sometimes a page with errors will look fine in one browser, but not another.  
		To check this have someone else in your lab group who's using a different browser 
		load your index.html page and follow the link to your bio.html page.  
		If you find there are any problems fix them.  
		Who did you ask to review your page?  
		What browser did they use?  
		Did you have to fix any HTML problems?
