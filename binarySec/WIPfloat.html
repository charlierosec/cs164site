				Floating point numbers are a rather complex topic that we don't touch much
				in this class. 
				We want you to have a general understanding of the topic.
			</p>

			<h2>Scientific Notation</h2>
			<p>
				Before we look at floating point, a topic we don't understand, let's look at
				a similar topic we do understand.
				Scientific notation is a notation most commonly used in Chemistry and Physics to
				represent both very large and very small numbers.
				Scientific notation has the following format.
			</p>
			<code>
				<center size="+4">
				<b>x * 10<sup>n</sup></b>
				</center>
				<br>
				<tab5>x : A number ranged [1.0, 10.0)</tab5>
				<br>
				<tab5>n : The power to which 10 is raised to</tab5>
				<br>
				<br>
				<tab5>Examples :</tab5>
				<br>
				<tab5>4500000000 : 4.5 * 10<sup>9</sup></tab5>
				<br>
				<tab5>0.0000000391 : 3.91 * 10<sup>-8</sup></tab5>
			</code>
			<p>
				As you can see, there is a very specific format this follows. 
				The <i>x</i> is never greater than 10. 
				If <i>x</i> were to be greater than 10, it means that we can multiply
				the answer by 10 again, and increase <i>n</i> accordingly.
				This process is incredibly important to understand, as it is very closely
				mimicked in floating point.
			</p>

			<h2>The Representation</h2>
			<p>
				Now that we understand how a floating point number works, we can look at how
				the computer will represent this number.
				As we mentioned before, the computer stores everything in strings of 0s and 1s.
				We've represented numbers fairly easily using a string of 0s and 1s, however,
				floating point isn't just a straight number.
				In floating point, we have a number, multiplied by another number that is raised
				to a power.
				Now, we could just take that answer and represent it using twos complement.
				However, we can use floating point to represent both very large and very 
				small numbers.
				If we're using a 32 bit system, we wouldn't be able to represent all numbers
				that floating point can represent.
				If only there was a way to represent the full floating point number in binary...
				Oh wait, there is!
			</p>
			<br>
			<code>
				<center>
					seeeeeeeemmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
				</center>
			</code>
			<br>
			<p>
				That clearly makes so much sense.
				Nothing confusing about that.
				Absolutely easy to understand.
			</p>
			<p>
				What does that long string of random letters mean? 
				First, let's recognize that each letter represents a bit, a 0 or 1.
				This would make the above a 32 bit number.
				This has one <i>s</i> bit, 8 <i>e</i> bits, and 23 <i>m</i> bits.
				Now, what do those letters mean?
			</p>
			<code>
				<center size="+4">
					<b>m * 2<sup>e</sup></b>
				</center>
				<br>
				<tab5>s : sign (positive or negative)</tab5>
				<br>
				<tab5>e : exponent</tab5>
				<br>
				<tab5>m : mantissa</tab5>
			</code>
			<br>
			<p>
				Just as before, the leftmost bit is the MSB (Most Significant Bit) and
				represents the sign of the number. 
				The exponent, in a 32 bit structure, is an 8 bit number.
				Finally, the mantissa is the main number.
				Let's look at the example in the slides.
			</p>
			<code>
				<center>
					+0.11 * 2<sup>1</sup>
				</center>
