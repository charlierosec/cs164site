      <h1>6.1 : Processing Language</h1>
      <hr>
	  <p>
        So let's talk a little bit about languages.
        What kind of languages are there?
        Here are a few common types:
	  </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="cardSec/assMach.html">Machine Language</a>
        <li><a href="cardSec/assMach.html">Assembly Language</a>
        <li>Network Protocols
        <li>Command Languages
        <li><a href="langSec/markup.html">Markup Languages</a>
        <li><a href="langSec/program.html">Programming Languages</a>
      </ul>
      <p>
        So we've already gone over assembly and machine languages (see 5.3),
        so I'm not gonna redo that. I also am not going to make a separate 
		section for Network Protocols and Command Languages as they aren't that
		applicable to this course. You've already used markup languages like HTML
		to build your website. Programming languages are most used to accomplish 
		a task. You'll be using Traquility in this course. These are incredibly
		basic descriptions for very large categories of languages. Each section 
		goes in more depth as to how each pertains to this course.

	  <h2>Doing Something With Something</h2>
	  <p>
			Now, that heading is nearly meaningless, but I couldn't really think 
			of a better heading.
			Programming is the art of doing things.
			Well, how are you doing things, by writing things.
			The things that you write and how you write them is determined by
			the type of language you are using. 
			With markup languages, you tend to write code in a way that allows text
			to be interpreted in a formatted way.
			With programming languages, you tend to write more action based code
			to achieve a goal.

	  <h2>Compiling Code</h2>
	  <p>
		While you may write symbols and text as code, most times, computers cannot
		read that code.
		The code needs to compiled into instructions that the computer can best 
		understand.
		Think about assembly and machine code and the CARDIAC.
		We write assembly code to put our thoughts and logic for the code on paper.
		When we input our code into the CARDIAC, we don't type words like ADD or INP,
		we type the machine code because that's what the CARDIAC understands.
		The CARDIAC doesn't understand ADD, but it understands 2. 
		The CARDIAC understands that when it recieves a 2 instruction, it should 
		perform a function that adds a value from a variable location to the 
		accumulator.
		In this scenario, you act as the "compiler" translating the assembly code
		into machine code.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		A compiler has the following parts:
	    <br>
		<b>Lexical Analyzer :</b> With lexical meaning "word" (close enough), it's 
		rather clear the the lexical analyzer, analyzes the words/code you wrote and
		breaks it into tokens.
		<br>
		<b>Parser :</b> The parser then takes these tokens and identify them. 
		Below, there's a quick section on parse trees. 
		I suggest taking a look.
		<br>
		<b>Symbol Table :</b> This tracks the declaration and use of names.
		This is what gives you that "Unknown Symbol" error when you mispell your
		variable names.
		<br>
		<b>Intermediate Code Generator :</b> Now an alternate representation of the 
		code is created.
		<br>
		<b>Code Generator :</b> Creates the code in the target language, the language
		whatever machine you are using best understands.
		<br>
		<b>Optimizer :</b> Improves the space or CPU usage of the code
	  </p>
	  <p>
		There's also an <b>interpreter</b> that processes the language and operations
		as they are being read.
		A good example of an interpreted language is Python (see CS-171/CS-172).
	  </p>
	  <hr>
	  <h2>Parsing and Parse Trees</h2>
	  <p>
		As mentioned above, parsing is the process of taking tokens and identifying
		them.
		We can use a parse tree to describe the behavior of a program. 
		Let's go through and create a parse tree for simple arithmetic operations.
	  </p>

	  <div class="container">
		<p>
			<code> var : 4 + (3 * 2 / 7) </code>
		</p>
		<img src="langSec/parsetree.png">
	  </div>
	
	  <p>
		The process is fairly simple.
		Break down the expression into order of operations. 
		The first and smallest order of operations become a the subtrees.
		From there, we build the parse tree upwards and outwards.
